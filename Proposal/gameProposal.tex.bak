	\section{Game}
			The player will be unable to move but will be able to rotate a full 360 degrees. The 	aim of the game is to overcome wave after wave of enemies while defending the forge behind 			the player. If the player can survive 10 waves then the final boss will attack, this boss 			will be mechanically unique compared to the hordes of enemies assaulting the forge but will 		easily have the strength of the entire wave.
	\section{Mechanics}
			Within the game the player will be able to rotate left and right, as to face the enemies with the 2 weapons at their disposal. The weapons will be a machine gun and a laser, the machine gun working by firing a number of shots per second the control is held down, the laser on the other hand will function by firing 2 shots in succession then waiting for a recharge before being able to fire again. In addition to these as an extension there may be other weapons implemented such as an explosive cannon that can fire a single explosive shot but will take a long time to recharge. 
			
			The enemies will function as slow moving but heavily armoured targets that will take only a single laser shot to defeat but will take concentrated fire from the machine gun. The enemies will have a shorter range than the player and will fire``Gauss'' weapons that function similarly to the laser but at a weaker power and faster rate.
			
			The boss will function completely differently to the mobs, it will have much more health and 3 types of attacks;
