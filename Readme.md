# The Game: #

The player has the ability to put up a shield in all 4 directions to dodge the incoming projectiles that are being directed towards the player. The user has to then make the decision of which button and which side to press in order to shield from the damage. This game would be based around a character that is on the chase from people with guns and the main goal is to not only to survive the onslaught but to take the least amount of damage as possible as this is reflected in the score at the end.



# Core Game Mechanics: #

- Directional shielding via. the buttons on the custom controller i.e. if a player is getting shot at on the left side, the button on the left side of the controller would need to be pressed. As such, if getting fired from different directions, two sides will need to be held and so on. This could be achieved with either a box controller or an item with a sensor which reflects the shielding direction in-game.

- Intricate decision making, based on the controller.

- A dash mechanic which provides invincibility during the animation duration in order to give a player a safe escape when in an emergency.
