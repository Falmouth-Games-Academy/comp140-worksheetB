##Game Proposal/ALT-Controllers (Revision)



# The Game: #

The player has the ability to put up a shield in all 4 directions to dodge the incoming projectiles that are being directed towards the player. The user has to then make the decision of which button and which side to press in order to shield from the damage. This game would be based around a character that is on the chase from people with guns and the main goal is to not only to survive the onslaught but to take the least amount of damage as possible as this is reflected in the score at the end. On top of this, the player has the ability to shoot back with a single button but has to do so whilst the shield isn't currently active so, there is a decision to be made constantly.

Genre: Action/Shooter
Camera: Top down, close to third person but not quite

Could also be some enemy variation, facing against enemies whom have the same shield, use the environment and obstacles to not have to shield. Different variations of this could be used in different settings to provide a significant difference in each stage even though the obstacles may still stay the same.



# Core Game Mechanics: #

- Directional shielding via. the buttons on the custom controller i.e. if a player is getting shot at on the left side, the button on the left side of the controller would need to be pressed. As such, if getting fired from different directions, two sides will need to be held and so on. This could be achieved with either a box controller or an item with a sensor which reflects the shielding direction in-game. This could also be done with two sticks, one will control the movement, the other will control the shield with a button residing somewhere in the middle.

- Intricate decision making, based on the controller. Have to constantly think about whether to defend or attack and in hectic situations, this may prove to be difficult.


- Some sort of movement mechanic like a sprint would help players that are stuck in a corner and have no way of getting out, this could be used in combination of the shield but needs to be balanced further to make sure the player doesn't feel invincible.
