## Alt Controller

#### The Game
The game intends to be a simple hot air balloon racing game with similar mechanics to Balloon Fight. You race predominantly vertically, with some horizontal parts, through checkpoints.
You are able to set back opponents by landing on top of them while also flying through the ringed checkpoints. Managing your ascension, decline, and direction with the balloon burner peripheral.

The core game mechanics are:
- The ascension and decline mechanics.
    These will have to be tuned in such a way that it replicates the way in which hot air balloons move, to an extent.
- Collision
    The balloons will be able to bump into each other which could be used to gain an advantage over checkpoints.
- The attacking mechanics
    Landing your basket on top of someone should result in them being "knocked out" and respawned
- The racing mechanics.
    Tracking player position on a 2D plain to decide who is in front.
- The checkpoint system
    This will be in aid of ensuring the race isn't just about who comes first but rather who was the "best" racer.

#### The Controller
The controller will look very similar to a hot air balloon burner with two burner coils mounted onto single unit burners. These will be attached to a set of "pipes" and then mounted to a stand which will allow for the player to move the burner forwards and backwards.
The controller aims to be a replica of a hot air balloon burner without the fire. It will have similar parts to control each burner.
A potentiometer will be attached to each burner and used to control the "gas." A button will be used for the "spark" to "light" the burner leading to more authenticity.
The burner will be mounted on a stand which you will be able to tilt forwards and backwards to move the balloon left and right. This will be achieved by using an accelerometer to track the momentum of the burner.
The controller will be 3D printed and smaller than a real life burner.
