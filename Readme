Alt controller game idea:

Infinite runner with walls that need to be turned off before the player hits them.
also holes to jump and a flip mechanic where you run along the ceiling
Walls will be colour coordinated to the controller, needed the correct matching 
colour input to turn them off.
During flip mechanic colours will be incorrect and the correct colour will be
written in the wall to add confusion.
Inputs made that dont match a wall on screen increase the the runner speed.
this can be good or bad depending as you can get a higher score faster, but also 
increases difficulty
Incorrect jumps are fine, incorrect flips will kill the player.

Controller ideas:
Idea 1:
LED lights matching the wall colours set infront of light sensors with gaps between
Player uses fingers to block the light from the LED to input
Thumb to jump
An additional button or something else for flip mechanic
All built into a base where the hand can be rested

Idea 2:
Glove with bend resitance sensors on each finger
fingers designated colour somehow, maybe LED
bend fingers and thumb to input
for flip either additional button, or sensor to tell if hand is upside down
make player turn hand over for flip
