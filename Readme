Game:

Game will have only 'endless' mode with enemies comming all the time untill player dies.
Player needs to shoot enemies (spawning on the top of the screen) before they reach base (bottom of the screen).
Player will get the points for killing the enemies, lose lives when they come to the bottom of the screen and loose ammo while shooting (player will have to reload the gun when out of ammo).
Player will have to move controller around to aim, press the trigger to shoot, getting the feedback with the motor and reload by pressign a button to release magazine and pushing it back.
UI shows lives counter, points counter and bullet counter (indicates when player will have to reload the gun).


Controller Research:

My controller (before I have realised it) is deeply inspired on a controller style to old game called "Duck Hunt" which utalized handgun-like controller to shoot flying away ducks.
In the game player was supposed to aim at the ducks on screen and press the button in order to shoot.
The controller was very simple two piece device built with a button that was for a player's input to shoot and a light sensor which pointed at the right spot on screen detected a hitbox of a duck.
I have varried from idea of using light sensor to use accelerometer because I liked the idea of using movement to just move things around on screen.
As it turns out current OLED and LED screens do not behave like old CRT monitors/tv's making it impossible to use light detector sensors (possible but would require screen-sensor synchronisation) so my way of implementing a controller can be a nice upgrade.
My version of a controller could be working in many different scenarios e.g. if the player couldnt point at the screen because of not enough space in the room or not possesing a CRT monitor/tv.


Controller:

Controller will be gunshaped with few movable components like a trigger and gun's magazine. 
Controller needs to have accelerometer/gyroscope, motor, IR proximity sensor, trigger (made of a button, a spring and a plastic trigger) built in.
