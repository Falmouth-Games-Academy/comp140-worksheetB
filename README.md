### Game Idea (Part A)
For my alt-controller game, I aim to make a 2 player, 3 Dimensional Tetris style game. Each Player will take control over one dimension of movement and rotation, and will have to work together to achieve the highest score possible. Various shaped blocks will appear at the top of the 3D arena, and will have to be strageically placed by both players to create full layers of blocks. Once a layer has been filled, it clears, and the player gets points for it. Clearing Multiple layers in a single turn, or clearing layers on successive turns, will increase the score mulitplier greatly, and as such planning ahead will be greatly rewarded.

### Controller plan (Part B - still needs research)
For the Controller itself, there should be some form of slider, wheel that can be spun, and a large button. The slider will be used to controll movement across each players axis, the wheel to control rotation, and the button will be used to save/retrieve different pieces for a later use.
For the design of it, I envision it having a square base that gets placed on a table, with the slider in the top left, spinning whell mounted upright in the topright, and the button in the bottom center.
