# GAME PROPOSAL
## Theme
My game is going to be about a teddy bear who is undergoing nanobot surgery. The player will remotely operate a nanobot in the bear's organism. 
## Main Mechanics
The player will operate the nanobot using a knob and a button, the knob will rotate the bot and the button will apply forward momentum. Think "Asteroids" but in a bear's body. The player will have to navigate the bot in such a way as to not damage teddy's healthy tissue and strike down any bacteria it encounters.

## Teddy Bear Mechanics
The teddy bear is gonna have two DC motors in his arms and an infrared proximity sensor in his mouth. If his tissue becomes damaged in the game by either the player or disease, the motors are gonna activate and the bear is gonna start freaking out in pain and moving his arms frantically. To calm him down, the player will have to press an anaesthetic mask to his mouth for a set period of time. The bear will then slowly stop moving as if he's falling asleep.
