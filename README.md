Buttons for firing missiles, switches for toggling on and off shields or engines. It could also have LEDs to indicate the ships status, like if the engines are damaged and need repairing.

### Potential stretch goals:
- Bosses
- Different enemy types
- Allies to help you fight
- Upgrades for your space ship

## Varation of game Concept #1

### Gameplay:
Instead of a general space exploration shootem up, it could be a more of a galaga vertical space shooter type of game, in which you are constantly moveing forwards and you have to avoid being damaged by enemy fire and obstacles like asteroids.

### Controller:
The ship will be controlled with a 3D printed physical model of the ship as a kind of joystick, so you could tilt it fowards, left right and back to move the ship ingame accordingly. The 3D modeled ship could have some buttons on it for the user to press to shoot. It could also have smaller control panel next to it to indicate ship status and have some extra input components for extra functionalties that might not be able to fit on the ship.

# Terminal point Attack (WIP TITLE)

## Quick Overall game Concept #2:

### Gameplay:
With the help of the hacking device (the custom controller) you hack your way throught multiple different minigames to obtain classified data and intel.

You use the controller which will look like a small hacking device, with it you solve hacking esque puzzle games, reflex games and guessing games.
It's a multiple minigames game.

Mini hacking game example: On screen you are given 3 angles in degrees and you are expected to move a potentiometer to these 3 degrees in order to get to the next puzzle.

### Controller:
The controller could have different types of input components such as buttons, switches, sliders, potentiometers. It could also have some LEDs to indicate info about the minigame currently being played.
