My game concept for my alternative controller will be a 2D trick shot pool game where the player
needs to pot the black using the white ball while avoiding obstacles.
I will use the physcis engine box2d to replicate the forces that act upon ball

there are many fouls a player can commit, these  fouls are: 
1.Potting the white 
2.hitting an obstacle 
3.failing to pot the black

This will cost the player lifes

My controller will be based on a life size pool que which the players uses to navigate the menus like a wii controller by using the que to aim and select. This will be done by attaching infaRed and pointing towards a reciever.
 
There are many different "Alt-controllers" in the games market. the most popular being the classic Wii remote controller. The Wii remote
came out in 2006 and was ahead of its time and  revolutionised the "Alt-controller" and how they work, how games can be devloped and what
games can become. The Wii remote uses infrared LEDs to sense light coming from the Wii sensor bar which is used for aiming the console's
cursor. The Wii remote also uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to help it dectect motion and calculate the speed and angle of the controller.
