In hopes to utilise the Arduino, I aim to create a virtual lockpicking system to that of Skyrim, or the Fallout franchise. This is where the player needs to turn a screwdriver like object inside of a locking mechanism to be able to breach the lock. Accompanied by an item called a 'bobby pin' or simply 'lockpick'. The goal of the activity is to get the bobby pin in a certain position, or 'sweet spot' so that the screwdriver can successfully turn. Thus opening the lock. Failing to do so however will leave the pin vunerable to breaking if the attempt is failed numerous times. 

The mechanics of the game will primarily be quite simple as the aim is to just "pick the lock". But, with the increase in level progression, there will be an increase in difficulty as well. Not to mention a certain intricacy to each of the levels as they may include multiple lock systems and other puzzling challenges. Similar to that of a lock and key brain teaser puzzle of sorts.

The display of the game will be a 2D image of a lock which turns according on how the player moves. There is a possibilty that this may change depending on the level however. But, I do believe that the main interface should be on the Arduino itself since it will be easier to indicate if the lockpick was successful via blinking lights and or possible sounds. Which will be housed in nicely designed casing. 

The only issue that I've found is that I don't really want to be teaching people how lockpick to commit a criminal act. So to combat this issue, I've come to a decision to use a more old fashioned or rustic design of lock and key since they're very rarely used in this day and age so this should resolve the issue quite well.
