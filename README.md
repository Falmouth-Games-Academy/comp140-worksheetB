# GAME PROPOSAL

## Theme
My game is going to be about a teddy bear who is undergoing nanobot surgery. The player will remotely operate a nanobot in the bear's organism. 

## Game Mechanics
The player will operate the nanobot using a knob and a button, the knob will rotate the bot and the button will apply forward momentum. Think "Asteroids" but in a bear's body. The player will have to navigate the bot in such a way as to not damage teddy's healthy tissue and strike down any bacteria it encounters.

## Physical Controller

### Existing controller research
- "The Revolutionary Watermelon That Wanted to Live Free as a Bird and Learned how to Escape" is a game where you control an in-game watermelon with a real-life watermelon by slapping it with your hand. It's an interesting, fun and unusual concept which makes for a fun and engaging experience.

- "Penultimo" is a katamari-like game where you play as a blob which collects blobs of different colours. The collest part about this game, is that it is hooked up to a big cocktail making contraption which creates a unique cocktail mix depending on what blobs you collect.

- "Incontroller" is a simple ball rolling game with an unusual way of increasing the difficulty. Instead of making the game itself harder, it makes the controller itself more difficult to use by making the arrow keys move both horizontally and vertically.

- "Orpheus Quest" is a rhythm game where you play on a harp. Not just any harp, but a laser harp. The ingenious contraption detects when your finger is obstructing a laser beam on the harp, which makes them function like strings.

### Teddy Bear Controller
The teddy bear is gonna have two DC motors in his arms and an infrared proximity sensor in his mouth. If his tissue becomes damaged in the game by either the player or disease, the motors are gonna activate and the bear is gonna start freaking out in pain and moving his arms frantically. To calm him down, the player will have to press an anaesthetic mask to his mouth for a set period of time. The bear will then slowly stop moving as if he's falling asleep.
