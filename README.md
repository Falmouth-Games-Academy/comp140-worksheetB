The game I have chosen to work on will use a wok as a controller. this wok will function in a similar sense to a wii controller, movements in different directions will be able to be detected and this will be used to control the game. 

## 
The game itself will be set at a stir fry stand in hongkong where you control a short asian man who loves making food for the cities residents. moving your wok in certain directions at the correct time will cook a great stir fry for your customers and affect the overall condition it is served in. Each level will be a different type of stir fry dish to serve and your movement and timing will affect the score you receive.
