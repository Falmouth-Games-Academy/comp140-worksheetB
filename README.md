## Part A - Arduino Game Controller Project

### Overview

For my game controller project I intend to create a game in the visual style of the original Elite games, or as close as possible, in 3D space.
As for the game controller itself, I have been thinking about ways to implement a 2-part controller:
* One part that would control the Player Ships's rotation on the 3 axis (and perhaps even movement speed) and
* Another part that would control the rest of the ships components, such as weapons.

### The game controller

The layout will consist of 2 parts: the right side will contain the movement controls, while the left side will control the ships' components.

For the Rotation and/or movement part, I intend to use either a Gyroscope (for rotations) attached to a potentiometer (for acceleration) or 4 potentiometer controlling the 3 rotational axis and the movement speed.

For the ship components controls' I intend to use, for starters, a single button layout for firing the weapons.

However, it should be noted that while the first part of the controller contains much of the most important controls, it may be cumbersome to use them all at once. Therefore, I was thinking about switching the movement controls to the second part of the controller to balance it out.

As for the exterior design of the controller, I was thinking about having either a button panel (for controlling the weapons) and some sort of outer casing (or fighter-style handle) for the gyro and acceleration potentiometer. Of course, that would mean that it would be able to rotate along all 3 axis as well as move forwards or backwards to determine the acceleration speed. As this may be cumbersome, I have also prepared an alternative layout.

The second layout I had in mind differs in only one aspect: the movement controls are next to the button panel, possibly as a handle that needs to be pushed forward or backwards to accelerate and deccelerate, respectively.

Finally, I intend to attach several LED's to the second part to display warnings such as fuel remaining, proximity warnings, damage wearnings etc. (Mostly for immersion)

The image above represents one of the layout ideas I had in mind, with separate controls for rotation and movement, while the image below illustrates a 3D prototype I put together just to illustrate the style I was looking to achieve. Then again, the style is subject to change, as I will need to research the 3D printing solutions I can make use of.

It should be noted that the 3D stick model contains the LED's at the top for different warnings and a big red button that could be used for firing the ship's weapons.

### The game itself

For the game itself I intend to create a simple 3D space exploration game, with some basic interactivity (such as landing on certain stellar objects or crashing into planets) and some basic combat. As for the type of game I will be aiming for, I would most likely go for sanbox, as it presents little restrictions to the player, and much creative freedom for me to add and remove ideas as I continue the development process. 

### Expected difficulties

As for the biggest setbacks I expect to encounter, I could name:
* My lack of knowledge in SDL will likely slow the initial development
* Since I will be using OpenGL I will need to research it intensely
* AI for enemies will certainly prove difficult, but I am confident that I can work it out
* Given the overall complexity of the game, I will need to work with the overall performance in mind
* I lacke xperience in working with electronics, so I will have to do some research on how to actually construct the controller
* I am still unsure whether to go for a cockpit-view or third-person view for the ship. 

### External references

[HOTAS controllers](https://www.windowscentral.com/best-hotas-controllers-vr): This controller is the go-to for the space exploration-combat-trading game Elite: Dangerous, which makes use of 2 main stick that control ship movement, rotation and weapon aiming. They also have several buttons to facilitate controlling other ship systems with ease. While I could not possibly hope to achieve a design as ergonomic or aesthetically pleasing as that, I have taken some inspiration from it mainly due to the ease of usage and immersion factor it provides to the player (The controller is visually identical to the in-game controls of the player).

[Logitech Flight Simulator Throttle](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/flight/flight-simulator-throttle-quadrant.html): This controller is similar to what I hope to use for the acceleration controller of the ship, using a potentiometer to determine the thrust given to the ship. One possible usage is to have 0 thrust at the middle position of the potentiometer and positive values when turning it one way and negative thrust when turning it the other way.

[Logitech Flight Simulator Switch Controller](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/flight/flight-simulator-switch-panel.html): The switch panel here presents ample control options for various in-game settings. While I will certainly not make use of as many features, I hope to have some immersive features on my panel, such as LED's, buttons or even switches that control different aspects of the ship.

[Original Elite ships](https://www.c64-wiki.com/images/thumb/0/0b/EliteShipIdentificationChart.jpg/800px-EliteShipIdentificationChart.jpg): These are the ships present in the original Elite game. I have placed these here just to illustrate the sort of visual style I will be aiming for. Minimalist, clean and hopefully performance-friendly.
