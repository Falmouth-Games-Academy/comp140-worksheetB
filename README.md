## Deep Sky - ### Beren Wallis
My concept for my game will be similar view style to Galaga: Destination Earth with a mixture of RPG elements much like Elite Dangerous. The player will be able to freely move around a galaxy and trade or bounty hunt for gold. Gold can be used to upgrade the players craft giving stats like armour, health or damage, with different weapon types being stronger against certain armour. A stretch goal for this project will be to randomly generate the world and nodes within the world such as space stations and ship breakdowns. The controller will give the player the ability to balance the power of the ship over certain power drainers such as shields and weapons. It will also give the ability to use certian items with the press of a button.
