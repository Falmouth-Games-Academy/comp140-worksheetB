Game Proposal 

 

Describing the game 

This game is called Bongo Hero, like other music-based games like guitar hero, DJ hero and so on, you’ll have to hit the bongos on the corresponding note when the notes are displayed on your monitor, failing to do some with penalise points, but you’ll gain points on successfully hitting the notes. 

 

Core mechanics 

You’ll choose a song from the song list that will be provided (Songs that include Bongos) the bongo notes will come down your screen in 6 different lanes and you’ll have to hit the bongos in the correct spot at the right time to receive the points, there will be pressure switch in each position of the bongo that the Arduino will pick up when the bongos have been hit in the right position, you will want to hit the notes in the correct position to get the most points for the song. 

 

Existing alternative controllers 

As my controller with be based off previous games like Guitar Hero, DJ Hero etc it’s easy to pull data from. Guitar Hero has a plastic guitar with buttons on it which you press when the relative colours appear on your screen, this is similar to how I plan on doing the Bongo Hero mechanics you just switch out the guitar for the bongos. Guitar Hero used its guitar for the controller whereas mine will be the bongos and it’ll record when the bongos are being hit and in what location.  

 

Description of my controller 

My controller is going to bongos that are connected to the Arduino, it’ll have pressure pads in 6 different locations on the Bongos, 3 on either side, the two sides of the bongo and in the middle on both sides, this will record the data when the player hits it in the said location and will send it to the game checking if they hit it correctly.
