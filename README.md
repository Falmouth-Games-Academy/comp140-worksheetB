Through the limitless potential of Arduino, I'm planning on encouranging people to drink more water by designing a game based around drinking from a water bottle (or at the least tilting the bottle further and further upwards as the game progresses).

Mechanics will include firing projectiles at enemies with a button, refilling ammunition by lifting the bottle upwards (encouraging the player to drink water) and moving left and right by rotating the bottle anti-clockwise and clockwise respectively.

The player will be at the bottom of a screen, moving upwards towards enemies and their fire at a consistent rate. Their interaction will consist solely of moving along the X-axis to dodge enemy fire and shooting at enemies to destroy them. Ammunition is limited and can be generously refilled by lifting the bottle upwards. 

The refilling of ammunition is not instant, the bottle must remain raised for a short period of time while ammunition slowly refills. Windows of relative calmness will be displayed in advance to the player, giving them a brief moment of respite with which to take a drink and refill their ammunition.

The game itself will aim to last around two minutes and will feature at least two different difficulty modes, as I feel providing an 'easy mode' is beneficial to the general accessibility of the game. It will be heavily influenced by games of the 'bullet hell' genre like Touhou and Nuclear Throne, forcing the player to precisely dodge endless streams of attacks, although the restriction to one dimension of movement will provide a challenge in balancing the difficulty.

Being exclusively two dimensional in design will play to SDL's strengths, but design of the sprites and sound effects will also be a challenge. Another challenge, though not explicitly related to the game itself, will be preventing the possibility of water damage to the electrical components attached to the water bottle. Both my artistic design and DIY craftsmanship skills will be tested heavily in this project, although I'm confident I can at least provide a well-functioning 2D video game experience.
