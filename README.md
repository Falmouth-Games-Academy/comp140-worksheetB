# Game and Controller Idea

I would like to create a top down 2D trebuchet game in which the player has to hit targets in the distance. 
To aim in a direction the trebuchet would rotate clockwise and anti-clockwise via a physical crank. 
The distance the projectile would travel would be based on how much weight was in a counterweight. 
I thought this could be simulated by placing various weights in a container with a pressure sensor or electronic scales.
