My game concept for my alternative controller will be a simulation of the popular pub game pool. 
It will replicate all the same rules as if you were playing it in person. 
The aim of the game is to use the white ball to pot other colored balls before your opponent pots his. 
Once your coloured balls have been potted you have to end the game by potting the black.  
there are many fouls a player can commit that can give the opponent a two shot advantage, these fouls are: 

1.Potting the white 
2.Potting an opponent's colour ball 
3.Not hitting a ball with the white 
4.Hitting the black ball first 

There are two fouls that can end the game instantly and give the opponent the win: 

1.Potting the black  
2.Potting the white after potting the black 

 There are many different "Alt-controllers" in the games market. the most popular being the classic Wii remote controller. The Wii remote
 came out in 2006 and was ahead of its time and  revolutionised the "Alt-controller" and how they work, how games can be devloped and what
 games can become. The Wii remote uses infrared LEDs to sense light coming from the Wii sensor bar which is used for aiming the console's
 cursor. The Wii remote also uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to help it dectect motion and calculate the speed and angle of the controller.
 
 My controller will be based on a life size pool que.
