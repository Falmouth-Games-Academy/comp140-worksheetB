## Proposal 3: Police car game
### Game Concept
Two players. One's a crook, the other's the cop. The crook's on the run! Flip on the sirens and lights and chase them down! Catch up with him in a top-down racer powered by tug and tilt controls. Move the car forward to accelerate, back to break, and to the sides to turn. Press down hard to initiate a powerslide! With your expert skill at the wheel, try to stop the racer by crashing their car or using a variety of weapons at your disposal.

### Controller Overview
Two base car models are needed, possibly Matchbox toys or custom-made cardboard cars. The controls of the game would ideally be powered by an elastic string, attached to the bottom of each car and going down into a hole in the table. This would create a slightly more dynamic elastic feel when working with the controls, such that when you go forward, you're physically tugging the car that way.  

A vibrating device is required for the satisfying feedback. LEDs are required for the siren lights. A stretch sensor could be used for the aforementioned string. A compass sensor could sense the rotation of the car body, and a tilt sensor could be used along with a concealed rod under the table to detetc the direction of the car relative to the hole in the table. Finally, a pressure sensor could detect whether the car is being pushed down (handbrake).  

For the ideal multiplayer experience, 2x of each hardware are required save for the LEDs.

## Mechanics
**Tilt:** Drive car  
**Push down:** Powerslide!/handbrake  
**Vibrate:** When powersliding, crashing, or hitting a speed boost.

### Prerequisites
**Car model:** Flashing LED lights. Working buzzer.

### Quirks
**Weapon:** Your main weapon is the megaphone, where you use emotinoal blackmail to make the criminal feel really really bad about what they're doing and they'll naturally slow down.  
**Alternative weapon:** Lasers of Justice. Blue and red lasers that you can shoot to the timings of your siren. As well as acting as an in-game projectile, the LEDs on the car also light up when you use them.
