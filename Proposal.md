# Proposal

Game Proposal - The game i am doing will be a classic side scroller along the lines of sonic and other classic sidescrollers but this one will have in a way a destuctable aspect to it.

The main mechanics will be thst the player can collect powerups on the way through the level to use to destroy items in there path, and as the game goes on the powerups change and some objects will require certain powerups to destroy them.
