# Proposal

Game Proposal - The game i am doing will be a classic side scroller along the lines of sonic and other classic sidescrollers but this one will have in a way a destructable aspect to it, and the game will have power ups which when all are collected the LEDs on the controller will all be lit.

The main mechanics will be that the player can collect powerups on the way through the level to use to destroy items in there path, and as the game goes on the powerups change and some objects will require certain powerups to destroy them.And once all the pick ups have been collected all the LEDs will light up and the level have been completed.


Controller Proposal - The Controller i am making will have a single sick and button, The stick to move the player about and the button for using thge powerups.
