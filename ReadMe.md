#Dream Catcher

In 'Dream Catcher', you play as an unnamed person whose sole purpose is to capture falling orbs (known in the game as dreams) from the sky. The game is in third-person and will take place in an arena which the player can roam around when chasing the orbs. It's best to think about it as a score-chasing'esque game where the amount of orbs, as well as the types, will affect your score at the end of a section.

The game will have a surreal aesthetic, with a relatively dark environment and sky, mixed with bright neon coloured orbs falling from the sky. 


##Core Mechanics
The orbs are arranged into different colours, with each colour coinciding with a stat the unnamed protagonist gains from collecting the orb. One colour may represent the speed the character can move at for instance.

By collecting the orbs, the player will accumulate a score, which after the section is over (decided upon based on a pre-determined timer) the player will be told and that score will then get added to the segment's leaderboard. This score will be graded out of letters (corresponding to potential scores in the game), and presuming the player doesn't reach the top score, they'll have a reason to go back and replay the level.

To collect the orbs the player simply has to run over to the orb and pick it up via a button press.

##Alt Controller
The controller will be kept relatively simple, with two stickers and a single button. The first sticker, which will be placed on the left-hand side of the controller, is for left-right movement (x-axis) and the other, which will be placed on the right-hand side of the controller, if for up-down movement (y-axis). The button is for the player to pick up the orbs from the ground in the game. Also the left sticker and button will be used for menu movement as well.
